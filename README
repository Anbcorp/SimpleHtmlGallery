Simple gallery generator

Written in python using jinja2 for templating and pil for thumbnail generation

Usage : put images and everything in the same folder, launch the script

This will generate a 512x512px thumbnail for each jpg file, then a index.html 
with all thumbnails and links to the full size image

Uses a (sort of) responsive design.

Written in half an hour as a proof-of-concept.
